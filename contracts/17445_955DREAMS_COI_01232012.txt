directors to office under the provisions of Section 3.2.1  (the “Specified Stock”) and such electing

those who are elected by the written consent of the holders of a majority of such Specified Stock.

Right to Convert.

4.1.1  Conversion Ratio.  Each share of a series of Preferred  Stock  shall 
be  convertible,  at  the  option  of the  holder  thereof,  at  any  time,  and  without  the  payment  of 
additional consideration by the holder thereof, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable 
shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the Original Issue Price for such series of 
Preferred Stock by the Conversion Price (as defined below) for such series of Preferred Stock in 
effect at the time of conversion.  The “Conversion Price” for each series of Preferred Stock shall 
initially mean the Original Issue Price for such series of Preferred Stock.  Such initial Conversion 
Price,  and the rate at which shares of Preferred Stock may be converted into  shares of Common 
Stock, shall be subject to adjustment as provided in Section 5.

4.1.2  Notice o f Conversion.  In order for a holder of Preferred  Stock to 
voluntarily convert  shares  of Preferred  Stock  into  shares  of Common  Stock,  such  holder  shall 
surrender the  certificate or certificates  for such  shares o f Preferred  Stock (or,  if such registered 
holder  alleges  that  any  such  certificate  has  been  lost,  stolen  or  destroyed,  a  lost  certificate 
affidavit  and agreement reasonably acceptable to the  Corporation to  indemnify the  Corporation 
against any claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft 
or destruction of such certificate), at the office o f the transfer agent for the Preferred Stock (or at 
the  principal  office  of the  Corporation  if the  Corporation  serves  as  its  own  transfer  agent), 
together with written notice that such holder elects to convert all or any number of the shares of 
the Preferred Stock represented by such certificate or certificates and, if applicable, any event on 
which  such  conversion  is  contingent  (a  “Contingency  Event').  Such  notice  shall  state  such 
holder’s  name  or  the  names  of the  nominees  in  which  such  holder  wishes  the  certificate  or 
certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued.  If required by the Corporation, certificates 
surrendered  for  conversion  shall  be  endorsed  or  accompanied  by  a  written  instrument  or

- 7 -

28352/0001 O/DOCS/2578489.2

instruments of transfer, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the 
registered holder or such holder’s attorney duly authorized in writing.  The close of business on 
the date of receipt by the transfer agent  (or by the  Corporation  if the  Corporation  serves  as  its 
own  transfer  agent)  of such  certificates  (or  lost  certificate  affidavit  and  agreement)  and  notice 
(or,  if later,  the  date  on  which  all  Contingency  Events  have  occurred)  shall  be  the  time  of 
conversion (the “Conversion Time"), and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion 
o f the  shares represented by  such  certificate  shall be  deemed  to be outstanding of record  as  of 
such time.  The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after the Conversion Time, (a) issue and 
deliver  to  such  holder  of  Preferred  Stock,  or  to  such  holder’s  nominee(s),  a  certificate  or 
certificates  for  the  number  of full  shares  of Common  Stock  issuable  upon  such  conversion  in 
accordance with the provisions hereof and  a certificate  for the number (if any)  of the  shares of 
Preferred Stock represented by the surrendered certificate that were not converted into Common 
Stock, (b) pay in cash such amount as provided in Section 5.7.3  in lieu of any fraction of a share 
o f Common  Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion and (c) pay all  declared but unpaid 
dividends on the shares of Preferred Stock converted.

4.1.3 

Effect of Voluntary Conversion.  All shares of Preferred Stock that 

shall have been  surrendered  for conversion as herein provided  shall  no  longer be deemed to be 
outstanding  and  all  rights  with respect to  such shares  shall  immediately cease  and terminate  at 
the Conversion Time,  except only the right of the holders thereof to receive shares of Common 
Stock  in  exchange  therefor,  to  receive  payment  in  lieu  of any  fraction  of a  share  otherwise 
issuable  upon  such  conversion  as  provided  in  Section  5.7.3  and  to  receive  payment  of  any 
dividends  declared  but  unpaid  thereon.  Any  shares  of Preferred  Stock  so  converted  shall  be 
retired and cancelled and may not be reissued.

4.2  Mandatory Conversion.

shares  of  Common  Stock  to  the  public  in  a  firm-commitment  underwritten  public  offering 
pursuant  to  an  effective  registration  statement  under  the  Securities  Act  resulting  in  at  least 
$20,000,000 of gross proceeds to the Corporation or (b) the date and time, or the occurrence of 
an  event,  specified  by  vote  or  written  consent  of  the  holders  of  at  least  a  majority  of  the 
outstanding  shares  of Preferred  Stock  at the  time  of such vote or consent,  voting together as  a 
single class on an as-converted basis (the time of such closing or the date and time specified or 
the  time  of the  event  specified  in  such  vote  or  written  consent  is  referred  to  herein  as  the 
“Mandatory Conversion  Time”), (i) all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall automatically 
be converted into  shares of Common Stock,  at the applicable ratio described in Section 4.1.1  as 
the  same  may be  adjusted  from  time  to  time  in  accordance  with  this  Section  4  and  (ii)  such 
shares may not be reissued by the Corporation.

4.2.2  Mandatory Conversion Procedural Requirements.

(a) 

All  holders  of record of shares  of Preferred  Stock shall be 

sent written notice of the Mandatory Conversion Time  and the place designated  for mandatory 
conversion  of all  such  shares  of Preferred  Stock  pursuant  to  Sections  4.2.1  and  10.  Unless 
otherwise provided  in  this  Restated  Certificate,  such notice need not be  sent in advance  of the 
occurrence  of the  Mandatory  Conversion  Time.  Upon  receipt  of such  notice,  each  holder  of 
shares  of Preferred  Stock  shall  surrender  such  holder’s  certificate  or  certificates  for  all  such

- 8 -

28352/00010/DOCS/2578489.2

shares  (or,  if such holder alleges  that  such  certificate has  been  lost,  stolen  or destroyed,  a lost 
certificate  affidavit  and  agreement  reasonably  acceptable  to  the  Corporation  to  indemnify  the 
Corporation  against  any  claim  that  may  be  made  against  the  Corporation  on  account  of the 
alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate) to the Corporation at the place designated in 
such notice,  and shall thereafter receive certificates  for the number of shares of Common  Stock 
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Section 4.2.

(b) 

If so  required  by the  Corporation,  certificates  surrendered 

for  conversion  shall  be  endorsed  or  accompanied  by  written  instrument  or  instruments  of 
transfer,  in  form  reasonably  satisfactory  to  the  Corporation,  duly  executed  by  the  registered 
holder  or by  such  holder’s  attorney  duly  authorized  in  writing.  All  rights  with respect  to  the 
Preferred  Stock  converted  pursuant  to  this  Section  4.2,  including the  rights,  if any,  to  receive 
notices  and  vote  (other  than  as  a  holder  of Common  Stock),  will  terminate  at  the  Mandatory 
Conversion Time  (notwithstanding the  failure  of the holder  or holders  thereof to  surrender the 
certificates at or prior to such time), except only the rights of the holders thereof, upon surrender 
of their certificate or certificates (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement) therefor, to receive 
the items provided for in the next sentence of this Section 4.2.2(b).  As soon as practicable after 
the  Mandatory  Conversion  Time  and  the  surrender  of  the  certificate  or  certificates  (or  lost 
certificate affidavit and agreement) for Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall issue and deliver to 
such holder,  or  to  such  holder’s  nominee(s),  a  certificate  or  certificates  for the  number  o f full 
shares of Common Stock issuable on such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof, 
together  with  cash  as  provided  in  Section  5.7.3  in  lieu  of any fraction  o f a  share  of Common 
Stock  otherwise  issuable  upon  such  conversion  and  the  payment  of any  declared  but  unpaid 
dividends  on the  shares  of Preferred  Stock converted.  Such converted Preferred  Stock  shall be 
retired and cancelled and may not be reissued as shares of such series,  and the Corporation may 
thereafter  take  such  appropriate  action  (without  the  need  for  stockholder  action)  as  may  be 
necessary to reduce the authorized number o f shares of Preferred Stock (and the applicable series 
thereof) accordingly.

4.3 

Termination of Conversion Rights.  Subject to Section 4.1.2 in the case of 

a Contingency Event, in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation 
or a Deemed Liquidation Event, the Conversion Rights shall terminate at the close of business on 
the  third  (3rd)  day  preceding  the  date  fixed  for  the  first  payment  of  any  funds  and  assets 
distributable on such event to the holders of Preferred Stock.

5.1.2  Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock.

(a) 

If the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the 
applicable  Original  Issue  Date  for  a  series  of  Preferred  Stock  shall  issue  any  Options  or 
Convertible  Securities  (excluding  Options  or  Convertible  Securities  which  are  themselves 
Exempted  Securities)  or shall  fix  a record  date  for the  determination of holders  of any class of 
securities  entitled  to  receive  any  such  Options  or  Convertible  Securities,  then  the  maximum 
number of shares of Common Stock (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto, assuming the 
satisfaction  of any  conditions  to  exercisability,  convertibility or  exchangeability (including  the 
passage  of  time)  but  without  regard  to  any  provision  contained  therein  for  a  subsequent 
adjustment  of  such  number  including  by  way  of  anti-dilution  adjustment)  issuable  upon  the 
exercise  of  such  Options  or,  in  the  case  of Convertible  Securities  and  Options  therefor,  the 
conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities,  shall be deemed to be Additional Shares 
of Common  Stock issued  as  of the time of such issue or,  in  case such a record  date shall have 
been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date.

(b) 

If  the  terms  of  any  Option  or  Convertible  Security,  the 
issuance of which resulted in an adjustment to the Conversion Price of a series of Preferred Stock 
pursuant to the terms of Section 5.1.3, are revised as a result of an amendment to  such terms or 
any  other  adjustment  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of such  Option  or  Convertible  Security  (but 
excluding automatic adjustments to  such terms pursuant to  anti-dilution or similar provisions of 
such  Option  or  Convertible  Security)  to  provide  for  either  (i)  any  increase  or  decrease  in  the 
number of shares  of Common  Stock issuable upon the exercise,  conversion and/or exchange of 
any  such  Option  or  Convertible  Security  or  (ii)  any  increase  or  decrease  in  the  consideration

occurrence of a record date with respect thereto)  shall be readjusted to  such Conversion Price of 
such series of Preferred Stock as would have obtained had such revised terms been in effect upon 
the  original  date  of  issuance  of  such  Option  or  Convertible  Security.  Notwithstanding  the 
foregoing,  no  readjustment pursuant to  this  Section  5.1.2(b)  shall  have  the  effect  of increasing

Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock that would have resulted from any issuances 
of Additional  Shares  of Common  Stock  (other than  deemed  issuances  of Additional  Shares  of 
Common  Stock as a result of the issuance of such Option or Convertible Security) between the 
original adjustment date and such readjustment date.

If  the  terms  of  any  Option  or  Convertible  Security 
(excluding  Options  or  Convertible  Securities  that  are  themselves  Exempted  Securities),  the 
issuance of which did not result in an adjustment to the Conversion Price of a series of Preferred 
Stock  pursuant  to  the  terms  of  Section  5.1.3  (either  because  the  consideration  per  share 
(determined  pursuant  to  Section  5.1.4)  of  the  Additional  Shares  of  Common  Stock  subject 
thereto was equal to or greater than the Conversion Price of such series of Preferred Stock then 
in  effect,  or because  such  Option or Convertible  Security was  issued before the  Original  Issue 
Date of such series of Preferred Stock), are revised after the Original Issue Date of such series of

the provisions  of such  Option or Convertible  Security (but  excluding automatic  adjustments  to 
such terms pursuant to anti-dilution or similar provisions of such Option or Convertible Security) 
to provide for either (i) any increase in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the 
exercise, conversion or exchange of any such Option or Convertible Security or (ii) any decrease 
in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion or exchange, then 
such  Option  or  Convertible  Security,  as  so  amended  or adjusted,  and  the  Additional  Shares  of 
Common  Stock subject thereto  (determined in the manner provided in Section 5.1.2(a))  shall be 
deemed to have been issued effective upon such increase or decrease becoming effective.

(d) 

Upon  the  expiration  or  termination  of  any  unexercised 
Option  or  unconverted  or  unexchanged  Convertible  Security  (or  portion  thereof)  that  resulted 
(either  upon  its  original  issuance  or  upon  a  revision  of  its  terms)  in  an  adjustment  to  the 
Conversion  Price  of  a  series  of  Preferred  Stock  pursuant  to  the  terms  of  Section  5.1.3,  the 
Conversion Price of such series of Preferred Stock shall be readjusted to  such Conversion Price 
of  such  series  of  Preferred  Stock  as  would  have  obtained  had  such  Option  or  Convertible 
Security (or portion thereof) never been issued.

(e) 

If the  number  of shares  of Common  Stock  issuable  upon 
the  exercise,  conversion  and/or  exchange  of  any  Option  or  Convertible  Security,  or  the 
consideration  payable  to  the  Corporation  upon  such  exercise,  conversion  and/or  exchange,  is 
calculable at the time such Option or Convertible Security is issued or amended but is subject to 
adjustment based upon subsequent events,  any adjustment to the Conversion Price of a series of 
Preferred Stock provided for in this Section 5.1.2 shall be effected at the time of such issuance or 
amendment based on  such number of shares  or  amount  of consideration  without regard  to  any 
provisions  for  subsequent  adjustments  (and  any  subsequent  adjustments  shall  be  treated  as 
provided in Sections 5.1.2(b) and 5.1.2(c)).  If the number of shares of Common  Stock issuable 
upon  the  exercise,  conversion  and/or  exchange  of any  Option  or  Convertible  Security,  or  the 
consideration  payable  to  the  Corporation  upon  such  exercise,  conversion  and/or  exchange, 
cannot be calculated at all at the time such Option or Convertible Security is issued or amended, 
any adjustment to such Conversion Price that would result under the terms of this Section 5.1.2 
at the time of such issuance or amendment  shall  instead be effected at the time such number of 
shares  and/or  amount  of  consideration  is  first  calculable  (even  if  subject  to  subsequent

-   12 -

28352/0001 O/DOCS/2578489.2

adjustments),  assuming  for  purposes  of calculating  such  adjustment  to  such  Conversion  Price 
that such issuance or amendment took place at the time such calculation can first be made.

5.1.3 

Issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock.  In the event the 
Corporation  shall  at  any  time  after the  applicable  Original  Issue  Date  of a  series  of Preferred 
Stock issue Additional Shares of Common Stock (including Additional Shares of Common Stock 
deemed to be issued pursuant to  Section 5.1.2), without consideration or for a consideration per 
share  less  than  the  Conversion  Price  for  such  series  of Preferred  Stock  in  effect  immediately 
prior to such issue, then such Conversion Price shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to 
a price  (calculated  to  the  nearest  one-thousandth  of a  cent)  determined  in  accordance  with  the 
following formula:

CP2 = CPi  *  (A + B) -  (A + C).

For purposes of the foregoing formula, the following definitions shall apply:

“CP2” shall mean the applicable Conversion Price in effect immediately after such issue 
or deemed issue o f Additional Shares of Common Stock

“CPi”  shall  mean  the  applicable  Conversion  Price  in  effect  immediately  prior  to  such 
issue or deemed issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock;

“A” shall mean the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to 
such  issue  or  deemed  issue  of Additional  Shares  of Common  Stock  (treating  for  this 
purpose  as  outstanding  all  shares  of Common  Stock  issuable  upon  exercise  of Options 
outstanding  immediately  prior  to  such  issue  or  upon  conversion  or  exchange  of 
Convertible Securities (including the Preferred Stock) outstanding (assuming exercise of 
any outstanding Options therefor) immediately prior to such issue);

“B”  shall  mean the number of shares of Common  Stock that would have been issued or 
deemed issued if such Additional Shares o f Common Stock had been issued at a price per 
share  equal  to  CPi  (determined by dividing the  aggregate  consideration received by the 
Corporation in respect o f such issue by CPi); and

“C” shall mean the number of such Additional  Shares of Common Stock actually issued 
or deemed issued in such transaction.

5.1.4  Determination of Consideration.  For purposes of this  Section 5.1, 
the  consideration  received by the  Corporation  for the  issue  or deemed  issue of any Additional 
Shares of Common Stock shall be computed as follows:

(a) 

Cash and Property:  Such consideration shall:

aggregate  amount  of  cash  received  by  the  Corporation,  excluding  amounts  paid  or 
payable for accrued interest;

(i) 

insofar  as  it  consists  of  cash,  be  computed  at  the

-

28352/0001 O/DOCS/2578489.2

insofar  as  it  consists  of property  other than  cash,  be
computed  at the fair market  value  thereof at  the  time  of such  issue,  as  determined  in
good faith by the Board; and

(ii) 

(iii) 
in the event Additional  Shares  of Common  Stock are
issued  together with  other 
shares  or  securities  or  other  assets  of the  Corporation  for
consideration  which  covers  both,  be  the proportion  of such  consideration  so  received, 
computed  as  provided  in  clauses  (i)  and  (ii)  above,  as  determined in good  faith by the 
Board.

(b) 

Options and  Convertible  Securities.  The consideration per 

share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been 
issued  pursuant  to  Section  5.1.2,  relating  to  Options  and  Convertible  Securities,  shall  be 
determined by dividing

(i) 

the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the 
Corporation as consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus 
the  minimum  aggregate  amount  of  additional  consideration  (as  set  forth  in  the 
instruments  relating  thereto,  without  regard  to  any  provision  contained  therein  for  a 
subsequent  adjustment  o f  such  consideration)  payable  to  the  Corporation  upon  the 
exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, or 
in  the  case  of  Options  for  Convertible  Securities,  the  exercise  of  such  Options  for 
Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, by

(ii) 

the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as 

set  forth  in  the  instruments  relating  thereto,  without  regard  to  any provision  contained 
therein for a subsequent  adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise o f such 
Options  or the  conversion or exchange  of such Convertible  Securities,  or in the  case of 
Options  for  Convertible  Securities,  the  exercise  of  such  Options  for  Convertible 
Securities and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities.

5.1.5 

Multiple Closing Dates.  In the event the Corporation shall issue on 

more than one date Additional  Shares  of Common  Stock that are a part of one transaction or a 
series of related transactions and that would result in an adjustment to the Conversion Price of a 
series  of Preferred  Stock pursuant  to  the terms  o f Section  5.1.2  and  such issuance  dates  occur 
within a period of no more than  120 days after the first such issuance to the final such issuance, 
then, upon the final such issuance, the Conversion Price of such series of Preferred Stock shall be 
readjusted  to  give  effect  to  all  such  issuances  as  if they  occurred  on  the  date  of the  first  such 
issuance  (and  without  giving  effect  to  any  additional  adjustments  as  a  result  of  any  such 
subsequent issuances  within  such period  that  are  a part  of such transaction or series  of related 
transaction).

5.2 

Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations.  If the Corporation shall at 

any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date for a series of Preferred Stock effect a 
subdivision of the outstanding Common Stock, the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred 
Stock in effect immediately before that subdivision shall be proportionately decreased so that the 
number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be 
increased  in  proportion  to  such  increase  in the  aggregate  number  of shares  of Common  Stock

-   1 4 -

28352/00010/DOCS/25 78489.2

outstanding.  If the  Corporation  shall  at  any time  or from time to  time  after the  Original  Issue 
Date  for  a  series  of Preferred  Stock  combine  the  outstanding  shares  o f Common  Stock,  the 
Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately before the combination 
shall  be  proportionately increased  so  that  the  number  of shares  of Common  Stock  issuable  on 
conversion of each share of such series  shall be decreased in proportion to  such decrease in the 
aggregate number of shares  of Common  Stock outstanding.  Any adjustment under this  section 
shall  become  effective  at  the  close  of  business  on  the  date  the  subdivision  or  combination 
becomes effective.

5.3  Adjustment  for  Certain  Dividends  and  Distributions. 

In  the  event  the 
Corporation  at  any  time  or  from  time  to  time  after  the  Original  Issue  Date  for  a  series  of 
Preferred  Stock  shall  make  or  issue,  or  fix  a  record  date  for  the  determination  of holders  of 
Common  Stock  entitled  to  receive,  a  dividend  or  other  distribution  payable  on  the  Common 
Stock in additional shares of Common Stock, then and in each such event the Conversion Price 
for such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately before such event shall be decreased as 
of the time of such issuance or,  in the event such a record date  shall have been  fixed,  as  of the 
close of business on  such record date, by multiplying such Conversion Price then in effect by a 
fraction:

(a) 

the  numerator  of  which  shall  be  the  total  number  of  shares  of 
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or 
the close of business on such record date, and

(b) 

the  denominator  of which  shall  be  the  total  number  of shares  of 
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or 
the  close  of business  on  such record  date plus  the number  of shares  of Common  Stock 
issuable in payment of such dividend or distribution.

Notwithstanding the foregoing,  (i) if such record date shall have been fixed and such dividend is 
not fully paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, such Conversion 
Price  shall  be  recomputed  accordingly  as  of the  close  of business  on  such  record  date  and 
thereafter such Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this section as of the time of actual 
payment  of such  dividends  or  distributions;  and  (ii)  no  such  adjustment  shall  be  made  if the 
holders of such series of Preferred Stock simultaneously receive a dividend or other distribution 
o f shares of Common Stock in a number equal to the number of shares of Common Stock as they 
would  have  received  if  all  outstanding  shares  of  such  series  of  Preferred  Stock  had  been 
converted into Common Stock on the date of such event.

5.4  Adjustments  for  Other  Dividends  and  Distributions. 

In  the  event  the 
Corporation  at  any  time  or  from  time  to  time  after  the  Original  Issue  Date  for  a  series  of 
Preferred  Stock  shall  make  or  issue,  or  fix  a  record  date  for  the  determination  of holders  of 
Common  Stock entitled  to  receive,  a dividend  or  other distribution payable in  securities  of the 
Corporation  (other  than  a  distribution  of  shares  of Common  Stock  in  respect  of outstanding 
shares  o f Common  Stock),  then  and in  each such  event the holders  of such  series  of Preferred 
Stock  shall  receive,  simultaneously  with  the  distribution  to  the  holders  of Common  Stock,  a 
dividend  or  other  distribution  of  such  securities  in  an  amount  equal  to  the  amount  of  such 
securities as they would have received if all outstanding shares of such series of Preferred Stock 
had been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event.

5.5 

Adjustment  for  Reclassification.  Exchange  and  Substitution. 

If,  at  any 
time  or  from  time  to  time  after  the  Original  Issue  Date  for  a  series  o f Preferred  Stock,  the 
Common  Stock  issuable upon the  conversion of such  series  of Preferred  Stock is  changed into 
the  same  or  a  different  number  of shares  of any  class  or  classes  of stock  of the  Corporation, 
whether  by  recapitalization,  reclassification  or  otherwise  (other  than  by  a  stock  split  or 
combination, dividend, distribution, merger or consolidation covered by Sections 5.2,  5.3,  5.4 or
5.6 or by Section 2.3 regarding a Deemed Liquidation Event), then in any such event each holder 
of such  series  of Preferred  Stock  shall  have  the right  thereafter to  convert  such  stock  into  the 
kind and amount of stock and other securities and property receivable upon such recapitalization, 
reclassification or other change by holders of the number of shares of Common Stock into which 
such  shares  of  Preferred  Stock  could  have  been  converted  immediately  prior  to  such 
recapitalization, reclassification or change.

5.6 

Adjustment  for  Merger  or  Consolidation.  Subject  to  the  provisions  of 
Section 2.3, if there shall occur any consolidation or merger involving the Corporation in which 
the  Common  Stock  (but  not  a  series  of Preferred  Stock)  is  converted  into  or  exchanged  for 
securities,  cash  or other property  (other than  a transaction  covered by  Sections  5.1,  5.3,  5.4  or
5.5), then,  following any such consolidation or merger,  provision shall be made that each share 
of such series of Preferred Stock shall thereafter be convertible in lieu of the Common Stock into 
which it was convertible prior to such event into the kind and amount of securities, cash or other 
property which a holder of the number of shares  of Common  Stock of the Corporation issuable 
upon  conversion  of  one  share  of  such  series  of  Preferred  Stock  immediately  prior  to  such 
consolidation or merger would have been entitled to receive pursuant to such transaction;  and, in 
such  case,  appropriate  adjustment  (as  determined in good  faith by the  Board)  shall be  made  in 
the  application  of the  provisions  in  Section 4  and this  Section  5  with respect to  the rights  and 
interests thereafter of the holders of such series of Preferred Stock, to the end that the provisions 
set  forth  in  Section  4  and  this  Section  5  shall  thereafter be  applicable,  as  nearly as  reasonably 
may be, in relation to any securities or other property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion 
of such series of Preferred Stock.

5.7 

General Conversion Provisions.

5.7.1 

Certificate  as  to  Adjustments.  Upon  the  occurrence  o f  each 

adjustment or readjustment of the Conversion Price of a series of Preferred Stock pursuant to this 
Section  5, the Corporation at its expense shall,  as promptly as reasonably practicable but in any 
event not later than  15  days thereafter,  compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance 
with the terms hereof and  furnish to  each holder  of such  series  of Preferred  Stock a certificate 
setting forth such adjustment or readjustment (including the kind  and amount of securities, cash 
or other property into which such series of Preferred Stock is convertible)  and showing in detail 
the  facts  upon  which  such  adjustment  or  readjustment  is  based.  The  Corporation  shall,  as 
promptly  as  reasonably practicable  after  the  written  request  at  any  time  of any  holder  of any 
series of Preferred Stock (but in any event not later than  10 days thereafter), furnish or cause to 
be  furnished to  such holder a certificate  setting forth  (a) the Conversion Price of such  series of 
Preferred Stock then in effect and (b) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if 
any,  of other securities,  cash or property which then would be received upon the conversion of 
such series of Preferred Stock.

5.7.2  Reservation  of Shares.  The  Corporation  shall  at  all  times  while 
any share of Preferred Stock shall be outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized 
but  unissued  capital  stock,  for the purpose  of effecting the  conversion  of the  Preferred  Stock, 
such  number  o f its  duly  authorized  shares  of Common  Stock  as  shall  from  time  to  time  be 
sufficient  to  effect  the  conversion  of all  outstanding  Preferred  Stock;  and  if at  any  time  the 
number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to  effect the 
conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall take such 
corporate action as may be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common 
Stock  to  such  number  of  shares  as  shall  be  sufficient  for  such  purposes,  including,  without 
limitation,  engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary 
amendment to this Restated Certificate.  Before taking any action that would cause an adjustment 
reducing  the  Conversion  Price  of a  series  of Preferred  Stock  below  the  then  par  value  of the 
shares  of  Common  Stock  issuable  upon  conversion  of  such  series  o f  Preferred  Stock,  the 
Corporation will take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary 
in order that the Corporation may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of 
Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion Price.

5.7.3  Fractional Shares.  No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be 
issued  upon  conversion  of the  Preferred  Stock. 
In  lieu  of any  fractional  shares  to  which  the 
holder  would  otherwise  be  entitled,  the  Corporation  shall  pay  cash  equal  to  such  fraction 
multiplied  by the  fair  value  of a  share  of Common  Stock  as  determined  in  good  faith  by the 
Board.  Whether  or  not  fractional  shares  would  be  issuable  upon  such  conversion  shall  be 
determined on the basis of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock the holder is at the time 
converting into  Common  Stock and the aggregate number of shares  of Common  Stock issuable 
upon such conversion.

5.7.4  No Further Adjustment after Conversion.  Upon any conversion of 
shares  of Preferred  Stock  into  Common  Stock,  no  adjustment  to  the  Conversion  Price  of the 
applicable  series  of Preferred  Stock  shall be made with respect to the  converted  shares  for any 
declared  but  unpaid  dividends  on  such  series  of  Preferred  Stock  or  on  the  Common  Stock 
delivered upon conversion.

its subsidiaries  shall be automatically and immediately retired and shall  not be reissued,  sold or 
transferred.  Neither the Corporation nor any of its subsidiaries may exercise any voting or other 
rights,  powers  and preferences  granted to  the holders  of Preferred  Stock following the  close of 
business on the third (3rd) day preceding the redemption date for such shares.

8. 

Waiver.  Any of the rights, powers, preferences and other terms of a series of the 
Preferred  Stock  or  the  Preferred  Stock  as  a  class  that  are  set  forth  herein  may be  waived  on 
behalf of all  holders  of such  series  of Preferred  Stock or the  Preferred  Stock  as  a class  by the 
affirmative  written  consent  or vote  of the  holders  of at  least  a majority  of the  shares  o f such

series of Preferred Stock or such Preferred Stock as a class that are then outstanding, treating any

Notice of Record Date.  In the event:

(a) 

the Corporation shall set a record of the holders of its Common Stock (or 
other  capital  stock  or  securities  at  the  time  issuable  upon  conversion  of the  Preferred 
Stock)  for  the  purpose  of entitling  or  enabling  them  to  receive  any  dividend  or  other 
distribution,  or  to  receive  any  right  to  subscribe  for  or  purchase  any  shares  o f capital 
stock of any class or any other securities, or to receive any other security; or

(b)

Common Stock of the Corporation, or any Deemed Liquidation Event; or

the Corporation,

then,  and in each  such  case, the  Corporation will  send or cause to be  sent to  the holders  of the 
Preferred  Stock  a notice  specifying,  as  the  case  may be,  (i)  the  record  date  for  such  dividend, 
distribution or subscription right, and the amount and character of such dividend,  distribution or 
subscription  right,  or  (ii)  the  effective  date  on  which  such  reorganization,  reclassification,

other capital  stock or securities at the time issuable upon the conversion of the Preferred  Stock) 
shall  be  entitled  to  exchange  their  shares  of  Common  Stock  (or  such  other  capital  stock  or 
securities) for securities or other property deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, 
consolidation, merger, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up,  and the amount per share 
and character of such exchange applicable to the Preferred Stock and the Common Stock.  Such 
notice shall be sent (A) at least twenty (20) days prior to the earlier of the record date or effective

the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock acting as a single class on 
an as-converted basis.

of the Corporation.

Corporation  as  a  consequence  of  such  compromise  or  arrangement,  the  said  compromise  or 
arrangement  and  the  said  reorganization  shall,  if  sanctioned  by  the  court  to  which  the  said 
application has been made, be binding on all the creditors or class of creditors,  and/or on all the
